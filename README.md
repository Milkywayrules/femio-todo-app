# Frontend Mentor - Todo app solution

This is a solution to the [Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

But their **_syle-guide.md_** file (free version) is not that good, you will just get confused by their limited amount of information you need. ðŸ¤£

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox (everywhere)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Host your React/Nextjs/Vue/Nuxtjs/Svelte/etc. for freeee
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS build tool
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For beautiful & veryveryvery great styling
- [react-beautiful-dnd (rbd)](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - For easy, beautiful, & accessible drag n drop
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - We know we write messy code, Prettier do the heavy work
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Again, we know we write untrusted code, TS do the heavy work
- [Jotai](https://jotai.org/docs/basics/comparison) - Use Recoil before? Or Redux? Zustand? Or use the context & reducer hooks? Try Jotai ðŸŽ‰

### What I learned

A lot! But, to be add later if I have more time to write ðŸš€

### Continued development

I still curious about the advanced implementation of render function. I use that in this project earlier but refactor it since the implementation of drag n drop feature. It's interesting and definitely love to explore more later.

### Useful resources

To be add later, for now take a look at **_Built with_** section above
